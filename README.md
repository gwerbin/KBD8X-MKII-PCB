# KBD8X-MKII-PCB

This is a modified version of the [original KBD8X MKII PCB](https://github.com/ai03-2725/KBD8X-MKII-PCB), which was
designed by ai03.

Changes from the original:

1. Flex cuts across the PCB are removed.
2. Additional reset switch is added on the front of the PCB. An aftermarket plate can be designed with a hole to
   reach this switch. This makes it possible to reset the board to bootloader mode without case disassembly and
   without relying on a software-based reset.
